# Intro

Some general remarks before we start.

# What we'll be using

 * Standard C++14
 * CMake
 
I will show examples with CLion on MacOS, but everything should be portable
as long as the IDE supports CMake and the compiler supports C++14.

# Approach

 * markdown documents (instead of slides)
 * code walkthroughs
 * a few questions in a shared pad: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/cleancodecpp-20201020

Feel free to ask specific questions at any time.
