# Intro

Some general remarks before we start.

# What we'll be using

 * Standard C++17
 * CMake 3.12
 * Visual Studio 2017 (15.8)

Visual Studio 2017 with that update should support almost all of C++17.
This can be checked here: [C++17 Compiler Support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp17)

# Approach

 * markdown documents (instead of slides)
 * code walkthroughs

Feel free to ask specific questions at any time.
