# Intro

Some general remarks before we start.

# What we'll be using

 * Standard C++17
 * CMake 3.12
 * GCC 8.3.0 (64 Bit)
 * Qt Creator 4.8.2
 
I won't be using these exact versions, but everything should be working, as GCC 8 is supposed to support almost all of C++17.
This can be checked here: [C++17 Compiler Support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp17)

# Approach

 * markdown documents (instead of slides)
 * code walkthroughs
 * a few questions in a shared pad: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/cleancodecpp-05072021

Feel free to ask specific questions at any time.
