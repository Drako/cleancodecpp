# Basic Rules of Bowling

* A game consists of 10 Frames
* Each frame consists of 2 Rolls
  * Except: When the first roll is a Strike (all 10 Pins fall), the Frame has only one Roll
  * Except: The last Frame can have up to 3 Rolls
* Strike: All 10 Pins fall with the first Roll of the Frame
  * The Score of the Frame is 10 plus the next two Rolls
* Spare: All 10 Pins fall with the second Roll of the Frame
  * The Score of the Frame is 10 plus the next 

As a result, the worst game consists of 20 Rolls of 0 and has a Score of 0.
The best game consists of 12 Strikes and has a Score of 300.
